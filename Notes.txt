- Http Client Issue Showcase

- Reuse vs non-Reuse of client
- Reuse of HttpHandler in order to order to set a request specific timeout
- Sync over Async problems (i.e. the power of async)
- Using a blocking method instead of Sync over Async
- DNS changes (how to control)
- The problems with an HttpHandler timeout
- Error handling (i.e. timeout vs cancellation, maybe others)
- Behavior of cancellation on the server
- Redirect behavior

Maybe:
- How to write client with specific control of parts of the timeout
- HttpClientFactory pros and cons

Ideas:
- Could we run the unit tests in docker? including from VS? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/remote-testing?view=vs-2022
  - Network setup might be an issue for this project
- With flag, wait for debugger attach in docker processes
